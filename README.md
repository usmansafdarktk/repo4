# Facebook Clone
**Facebook Clone** is a Python-based social networking system that replicates the core functionalities of Facebook. This project covers fundamental features such as user profiles, friend requests, posts, comments, and messaging. Additionally, advanced features like page creation and user blocking mechanisms have been implemented to enhance user experience. A user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) has been integrated for improved usability.

## Object-Oriented Programming Principles

The project emphasizes the following OOP principles:
- **Encapsulation**: Ensuring data is protected from outside interference.
- **Information Hiding**: Keeping internal object details hidden from the outside.
- **Inheritance**: Allowing new classes to inherit attributes and methods from existing classes.
- **Polymorphism**: Enabling methods to do different things based on the object.
- **Coupling and Cohesion**: Designing modules that are loosely coupled and highly cohesive.
